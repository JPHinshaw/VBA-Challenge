# VBA-Challenge

I started the challenge using code that we learned in various activities during the VBA unit.

I had problems getting my code to loop through multiple worksheets as well as other small errors that I could not figure out.

I watched the walkthrough video that Dr. A. posted and coded alongside the video and was able to get my script to loop as well as my minor problems figured out.
